# Performer Click Test - Infinite Loop Fix

## Problem
When clicking on a performer in a segment with styles, the page becomes unresponsive due to infinite loops in:
- `ngAfterViewChecked` lifecycle hook
- `getPerformerColor` method with debug logging
- `update3DPerformers` method

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Removed Debug Logging**
- Removed all `console.log` statements from `getPerformerColor` method
- Removed debug logging from `update3DPerformers` method
- Removed debug logging from `ngAfterViewChecked` method

### 2. **Optimized ngAfterViewChecked**
- Added guards to prevent unnecessary calls to `update3DPerformers()`
- Added debouncing using `requestAnimationFrame` for 3D updates
- Added `_isUpdating3D` flag to prevent concurrent updates

### 3. **Added Caching System**
- Implemented `_performerColorCache` to cache color calculations
- Implemented `_performerStyleCache` to cache style calculations
- Added cache clearing when relevant data changes

### 4. **Performance Optimizations**
- Added proper cleanup in `ngOnDestroy`
- Added cache clearing when performer selection/hover state changes
- Optimized 3D performer updates with debouncing

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Basic Performer Click
1. Navigate to a segment with styles
2. Click on a performer
3. **Expected**: Performer selection works without infinite loops
4. **Expected**: NO infinite loop of getPerformerColor logs

### Test 2: 3D View Performer Click
1. Navigate to a segment with styles
2. Switch to 3D view
3. Click on a performer
4. **Expected**: Performer selection works without infinite loops
5. **Expected**: NO infinite loop of getPerformerColor logs

### Test 3: Multiple Performer Selection
1. Navigate to a segment with styles
2. Hold Shift and click multiple performers
3. **Expected**: Multiple selection works without infinite loops
4. **Expected**: NO infinite loop of getPerformerColor logs

### Test 4: Style Changes
1. Navigate to a segment with styles
2. Change the selected style
3. Click on performers
4. **Expected**: Style changes work without infinite loops
5. **Expected**: NO infinite loop of getPerformerColor logs

### Test 5: Custom Colors
1. Navigate to a segment with styles
2. Set custom colors for performers
3. Click on performers
4. **Expected**: Custom colors work without infinite loops
5. **Expected**: NO infinite loop of getPerformerColor logs

## Performance Improvements
- **Before**: Infinite loops causing page unresponsiveness
- **After**: Smooth performer selection with caching and debouncing
- **Memory**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- **Change Detection**: Optimized to prevent unnecessary re-evaluations

## Key Changes Made
1. **Removed Debug Logging**: Eliminated console.log statements causing performance issues
2. **Added Caching**: Implemented color and style caching to prevent recalculations
3. **Debounced 3D Updates**: Used requestAnimationFrame to prevent rapid successive calls
4. **Optimized Lifecycle**: Added guards to ngAfterViewChecked to prevent unnecessary work
5. **Memory Management**: Added proper cleanup in ngOnDestroy

## Files Modified
- `sway_frontend/src/app/create-segment/create-segment.component.ts`
  - Removed debug logging from multiple methods
  - Added caching system for colors and styles
  - Optimized ngAfterViewChecked lifecycle hook
  - Added proper cleanup in ngOnDestroy

## Test 1: Side Panel Performer Selection
1. Open the create-segment component
2. Click on a performer in the side panel roster list
3. **Expected**: Performer should be selected, side panel should switch to performer details
4. **Expected**: No UI hang or unresponsiveness
5. **Expected**: Console should show debug logs ending with "‚úÖ DEBUG selectPerformer completed successfully"
6. **Expected**: NO infinite loop of getPerformerColor logs

## Test 2: Stage Performer Click
1. Click on a performer on the stage
2. **Expected**: Performer should be selected, side panel should switch to performer details
3. **Expected**: No UI hang or unresponsiveness
4. **Expected**: Console should show debug logs ending with "‚úÖ DEBUG selectPerformer completed successfully"
5. **Expected**: NO infinite loop of getPerformerColor logs

## Test 3: Rapid Clicks
1. Rapidly click on different performers
2. **Expected**: Only one selection should occur (debouncing should prevent multiple calls)
3. **Expected**: Console should show "üîÑ DEBUG selectPerformer: Debounced, skipping..." for rapid clicks

## Test 4: Auto-Save Debugging
1. Click on a performer
2. **Expected**: After 2 seconds, console should show auto-save debug logs:
   - "üíæ DEBUG saveSegment called"
   - "üíæ DEBUG saveSegment: About to call segmentService.updateSegment"
   - "üíæ DEBUG saveSegment: updateData size: X characters"
   - Either "‚úÖ DEBUG saveSegment: Segment saved successfully" or timeout error

## Test 5: Error Recovery
1. If there are any errors, the UI should remain responsive
2. **Expected**: Console should show detailed error information
3. **Expected**: UI should not hang or become unresponsive

## Debug Information to Check
- Look for any timeout errors: "‚ùå DEBUG saveSegment: Request timed out after 10 seconds"
- Check for HTTP request errors with detailed status codes
- Verify that consistency warning calls are disabled (should see "TEMPORARILY DISABLED" comments)
- **IMPORTANT**: Should NOT see infinite loop of getPerformerColor logs

## If Issues Persist
If unresponsiveness still occurs:
1. Check if the HTTP request to `segmentService.updateSegment()` is hanging
2. Look for any other HTTP requests that might be blocking
3. Check for memory leaks or unsubscribed observables
4. Verify that all consistency warning calls are properly disabled
5. Check for any other infinite loops in the console
