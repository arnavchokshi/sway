## How to Test

### 1. Memory Usage Test
- Open browser DevTools → Performance tab
- Start recording memory
- Navigate to create-segment page
- Click on performers multiple times
- Navigate away from the page
- Navigate back to the page
- Repeat this cycle 5-10 times
- Stop recording and check memory usage
- ✅ Memory should not continuously increase

### 2. Click Responsiveness Test
- Navigate to create-segment page
- Click rapidly on performers in the side panel list
- Click rapidly on performers on the stage
- ✅ Page should remain responsive
- ✅ No "unresponsive" errors should appear

### 3. Console Log Test
- Open browser DevTools → Console tab
- Navigate to create-segment page
- Click on a performer
- Navigate away from the page
- ✅ Should see: `✅ DEBUG ngOnDestroy: Component cleanup completed`
- ✅ No memory leak warnings in console

### 4. Network Request Test
- Open browser DevTools → Network tab
- Navigate to create-segment page
- Click on performers multiple times
- Navigate away and back multiple times
- ✅ No hanging network requests
- ✅ All requests should complete or be cancelled

### 5. 3D Scene Test
- Navigate to create-segment page
- Switch to 3D view
- Navigate away from the page
- Navigate back
- Switch to 3D view again
- ✅ 3D scene should load properly each time
- ✅ No WebGL context errors

## Expected Results

After the fixes:
- ✅ No memory leaks
- ✅ Page remains responsive during rapid clicks
- ✅ All resources are properly cleaned up
- ✅ No console errors related to memory
- ✅ Smooth navigation between pages
- ✅ No hanging network requests

## Debug Information

The component now logs cleanup completion:
```
